Dominion Kingdom Builder/Randomizer
========================
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

A kingdom builder/randomizer for the Dominion card game and its expansions. User's will be able to enter desired kingdom 
rules and the card sets that they have available. The application will then return a uniquely confiurged kingdom with options
for further customizations and tweaks.


About
==============

This was web app was build using Angular and Twitter Bootstrap. I haven't loaded all the cards data yet, but as soon as that is
done, I plan on open sourcing the JSON data for the cards. Data entry has so far been the worst part of the project, and hopefully
I can save other people time in the future.


Demo
==============

This is still a work in progress, but you can view the latest iteration at http://www.schnogz.com/projects/dominionBuilder/Randominion.html
